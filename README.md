#         Gyojin-Ryu!   My  Pokémon Project

##  An design experiment to make cute monsters look scary (and learn some Boostrap too).

This page was produced during my fourth week at the New York Code and Design Academy.  This was my second foray into web design 
and I decied to tackle the following challenges in addition to learning HTML/CSS5


###  Design Challenges
 
 * My Goal: FLip the concept of cute anime creatures everyone knows and loves on its head.

    - Can you make pokémon frightening rather than cute and sweet?
       
       My thinking is first we need to mute the colors of the show.  Take it from pretty, bright tones, 
       to muted steel and blues to give it a heavier feel.  
         
        Secondly, animation is a very expressive medium, bright faces with exagurated 
        features clearly define who is good and who is bad and what they are thinking.  
        As a result I wanted my images on the site  to lack that. 
        The only faces on the site are heavily obscured giving little 
        emotion or are done in an ancient japanese-style that broadcast little emotion.  
        
        
    - Is there another take on the traditional pokémon narrative, a darker one?
        
        I wanted to make a villian who would emphasize a dark side of the pokémon story.  
        I decided on a sort of ancient ninja/corbra-kai highbrid and treat the page as a 
        sort of recruitment page for his style of poké-training to create a more immersive 
        feel, as if this site could be found in the pokémon world.
   
    
    - Does it still somehow connect with the original material?
        
        With a backgorund in Broadway theatre, im verty sensitive to theme and think that everything in 
        the page is either adding to or taking from that theme.  Everything from the buttons to the 
        images and color schemes and fonts is all pointing towards a darker side of a japanese 
        influenced design that stays within the  constraints that the pokémon universe 
        established while still feeling free to explore things in a different direction.
    
    
###  Technical Challenges

 * This is my second website ever, the code was intentionally left the way it was when turned in
  
    - Bootstrap!
      This was my first attempt to work with boostrap.  Learning the grid system alongside CSS and HTML.
      
    -  First API
        This was my first attempt at using an API.  The site makes an AJAX call to the official pokémon API and brings back
        statistics for three pokémon.
